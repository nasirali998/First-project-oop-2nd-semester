Introduction: The Employee Management System is a complete software solution designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a employee with ease and efficiency. The system begins with a secure login page, ensuring that only authorized users can access the features of the application. Once logged in, users can add new members, each of whom is automatically assigned a unique ID for accurate identification. The system maintains a dynamic list of all registered members, with full functionality to update, delete, or search any member using their unique ID. It also  where individual employee records are maintained for each member. All data, including member profiles and  details, is safely stored in a MySQL database, with separate tables for members and data , ensuring data security, consistency, and fast retrieval.
